# Step 3 - Integrate SDK
Once pipeline's status becomes `Active`, it is ready to receive clickstream data. Now you need to register an application to the pipeline, then you can integrate SDK into your application to enable it to send data to the pipeline.

## Steps

1. Log into **Clickstream Analytics on AWS Console**.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Projects**, then select the project (`quickstart`) you just created in previous steps, click its title, and it will bring you to the project page.
3. Choose **+ Add application** to start adding application to the pipeline.
4. Fill in the form as follows:
     * App name: **`test-app`**
     * App ID: The system will generate one ID based on the name, and you can customize it if needed.
     * Description: **`A test app for Clickstream Analytics on AWS solution`**
     * Android package name: leave it blank
     * App Bundle ID: leave it blank

4. Choose **Register App & Generate SDK Instruction**, and wait for the registration to be completed.

5. Select the tab **Android**, and you will see the detailed instruction of adding SDK into your application. You can follow the steps to add SDK.

6. Click the **Download the config json file** button to download the config file, and keep this file open, which will be used later.

It will take about 3 ~ 5 minutes to update the pipeline with the application you just add. When you see the pipeline status become **Active** again, it is ready to receive data from your application. 

We have completed all the steps of adding an application to a project.

## Generate sample data
You might not have immediate access to integrate SDK with your app. In this case, we provide a Python script to generate sample data to the pipeline you just configured, so that you can view and experience the analytics dashboards.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
### Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
   ```code
   git clone {{ git_repo }}
   ```
2. After you cloned the repository, change directory into the `examples/standalone-data-generator` project folder.

3. Install the dependencies of the project.
    ```code
    pip3 install requests
    ```

4. Put `amplifyconfiguration.json` into the root of `examples/standalone-data-generator` which you downloaded in **register an app** step. See the `examples/standalone-data-generator/README.md` for more usages.

5. Open an terminal at this project folder location. For example, if you are using Visual Studio Code IDE, at the top of **Visual Studio Code**, click **Terminal** -> **New Terminal** to open a terminal.

6. Copy the following command and paste it to the terminal:

    ```shell
    python3 create_event.py
    ```

Hit `Enter` key in terminal to execute the program. If you see the following output, this means that the program execution is complete.

 ```shell
 job finished, upload 4360476 events, cost: 95100ms
 ```

This process will take about 10 minutes with default configuration. After job is finished, you can move to next step.
